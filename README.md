# Neural Network
A Neural Network which take 2 inputs: an image from the MNIST dataset (say 5), and a random number between 0 and 9, (say 7)  and gives two outputs: the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image (predict 5), and the "sum" of this number with the random number and the input image to the network i,e 12
